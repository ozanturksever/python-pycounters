        0.5:
            - Fixed - locking issue with JSON output files
            - Fixed - EventCounter did not respond to events keyword argument
        
        0.4:
            - added a patcher util class to allow injecting events to existing libraries/code.
            - decoupled counter names from the names of events they count. Still, by default a counter will count events with
              it's name
            - shortcut decorators now take the name of the function they wrap as a default event name
            - Added a role option to multi process reporting initializations.
            - Made all report_* and shortcuts decorators usable as context managers.
            - Munin plugin now ignores old reports by default
            - Counters which doesn't have any value now return None instead of 0.
            - Fixed an issue with aggregation of average values when not all sources had the same value
            - Added output_report() to allow manual initiation of reports.
